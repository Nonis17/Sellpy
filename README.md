## About The Project

This project was a part of my front end developer education in 2021. It was part of a UX design implementation course. The theme for the project was sustainability, espescially sustainable consumption/circular economy. I started with doing UX research interviewing people about sustainable consumption, finding out what the needs are for the users, and from that created an extra feature for the company Sellpy called Sellpy service hall. Note that this is a fiction case. After creating a Figma prototype, I built the website accordingly. The only feature in this project is the sellpy service hall, there are no other features.
